## About

K67 is a very simple map based tool created for the purpose of demonstrating the effectivness of using LIDAR and readily available aerial imagery, to locate Irish Archaeological Features. Essentially just a webpage, K67 uses the brilliant Leaflet mapping framework to present a collection of Map and Overlay layers which can be used to identify features in the Irish landscape and easily determine if features have a record associated with them in the the National Monuments Database.
